			<h1>Greetings, delegates!</h1>
			<p>Ten years ago, our alumni sought to give form to a dream; to provide a forum where students would not only polish their speaking skills but also gain insight into the policies and cultures of different countries. Their hard work made this dream a reality into the form of MUNIC, now an annual tradition at City School Capital Campus.<br><br>As the Secretary General of MUNIC TEN, it is my solemn duty to create an atmosphere of debates in which veterans may test their mettle with fellow peers and beginners can learn. However, that is not all I hope to achieve. This MUNIC, we are integrating technology with debates to make this MUN not only more interactive for the delegates but also push the diplomacy out of the committee room. Moreover, with the game changing app in development, I assure you that this MUNIC will be much closer to what real-life policymakers and diplomats go through when faced with crisis.<br><br>So I invite you all to MUNIC TEN, to debate passionately, to make friends, to make memories, to make history.</p>
