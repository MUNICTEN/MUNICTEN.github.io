			<h1>Greetings, delegates!</h1>
			<p>Ten years ago, our alumni sought to give form to a dream; to provide a forum where students would not only polish their speaking skills but also gain insight into the policies and cultures of different countries. Their hard work made this dream a reality into the form of MUNIC, now an annual tradition at City School Capital Campus.<br><br>As the Secretary General of MUNIC TEN, it is my solemn duty to create an atmosphere of debates in which veterans may test their mettle with fellow peers and beginners can learn. However, that is not all I hope to achieve. This MUNIC, we are integrating technology with debates to make this MUN not only more interactive for the delegates but also push the diplomacy out of the committee room. Moreover, with the game changing app in development, I assure you that this MUNIC will be much closer to what real-life policymakers and diplomats go through when faced with crisis.<br><br>So I invite you all to MUNIC TEN, to debate passionately, to make friends, to make memories, to make history.</p>

This MUNIC, we are integrating technology with debates to make this MUN not only more interactive for the delegates but also also to extract every bit of diplomacy each delegate has to offer. Moreover with the game changing app in development, one thing stays assured that this MUN will be a lot closer to what professional diplomats and negotiators go through when met with a major crisis.<br><br>Hence, I invite you all to get not only experience, but make memories, friends and get to know the MUNIC family simply by joining us at MUNIC TEN.</p>

			'UNDP': "United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) formed in 1965 to help countries eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable human development, an approach to economic growth that emphasizes improving the quality of life of all citizens while conserving the environment and natural resources for future generations. The UNDP is headed by an administrator who oversees a 36-member Executive Board representing both developing and developed countries.The UNDP also makes experts available to help developing countries increase their capacity for good governance by building political and legal institutions that are equitable, responsive, and open to public participation and to expand the private sector of their economies in order to provide more jobs.UNDP’s partnership with the Global Fund is a powerful contributor to health-related development goals, through the key role it plays in supporting countries facing challenging circumstances to strengthen their institutions, systems for health and enable access to essential health services.",
			'UNSC': "The UN Charter established six main organs of the United Nations, including the Security Council. It gives primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security to the Security Council, which may meet whenever peace is threatened. Each Member in the committee has one vote and under the Charter, all Member States are obligated to comply with Council decisions.<br><br>Its powers include the establishment of peacekeeping operations, imposing international sanctions, and the authorization of military action through Security Council resolutions; it is the only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions to member states.<br><br>The Security Council also recommends to the General Assembly the appointment of the Secretary-General and the admission of new Members to the United Nations. And, together with the General Assembly, it elects the judges of the International Court of Justice.",
			'UNW': "The United Nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women (UNW) was formally created by the UN general assembly in 2010, born from a merger of several previously extant bodies and committees pertaining to interests of similar nature. It’s role was to help member states to recognise the rights that should be provided to women, to promote gender equality, and to provide financial support to countries that stand by it. The mandate and functions of UN Women consist of the consolidated mandates and functions of the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, the Division for the Advancement of Women, the United Nations Development Fund for Women, and the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women. In addition, the entity must lead, coordinate, and promote the accountability of the United Nations system in its work on gender equality and women\'s empowerment.",
			'ICAC': "Fulfilling its promise of bringing forward a conference that stands distinct from its predecessors, MUNIC TEN has introduced a new committee this year: the International Crisis Ad-hoc Committee (ICAC). An Ad-hoc committee differs from other committees in the way it operates: the delegates have to come up with solutions for a global crisis that is presented on the spot i.e. there is no predefined agenda. Therefore, it offers an unconventional opportunity to delegates who are not easily dismayed by new challenges and possess the ability to think and act spontaneously and innovatively. Moreover, it breeds a sense of teamwork and harmony amongst the delegates and ensures an exciting debate experience for them.",
			'ICC': "The International Cricket Council, with its motto ‘Championing World Cricket’,stands as the principle organization for cricket. Originally founded in 1909 by England, Australia and South Africa, it has expanded since then to include 10 permanent members and 95 Associate and Affiliate members. Today it administers and conducts all international Cricket tournaments - most significantly the Cricket World Cup. Officiating umpires and referees at test matches, it endorses a ‘Code of Conduct’ and ordinates action against corruption by maintaining professional standards of order.",
			'PNA': "The National Assembly of Pakistan,formed in 1947,is the lower house of the bicameral Majlis-e-shura. It is the country's legislative body where political views within the spectrum of Pakistan are discussed and proposals are brought up by the members of parliament to be voted upon and implemented. Members of parliament are elected through a general election in which citizens vote to elect representatives. It ensures that the government functions within the parameters set out in the constitution and does not violate the rights of citizens. It is a platform to transform the face of pakistani politics,so delegates,lets see how well you play and what solutions you bring to take our beloved country to heights of advancement!",
			'DISEC': "The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC), founded in 1945, is the first out of the six committees of the General Assembly. DISEC deals with crucial topics that revolve around disarmament, universal adversity and threats to the tranquility of the international community. For years, this committee has continued to serve as the very platform for the world's population, to debate issues pertaining to creating and maintaining global security by seeking out solutions to the challenges in the international security regime. Debates are performed considering only disarmament and international security affairs within the range of the UN Charter. DISEC cannot oblige countries to take a definite action, but can make recommendations to the Security Council about what should be done on a specific issue. This February, DISEC returns to Model United Nations in City, as the increase in the impetuous use of weapons and growing security threats cause DISEC to become increasingly significant and impactful to the modern society.",
			'SOCHUM': "The Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee (SOCHUM) is the third General Assembly of the United Nations, tasked with a broad mandate surrounding social, humanitarian and human rights issues from around the world. To delineate a general idea of the committee, some issues discussed within SOCHUM include but are not limited to: human rights, global literacy, women’s rights, children’s rights, the treatment of refugees and displaced persons, international drug control, crime prevention, and the elimination of racism and discrimination. SOCHUM also works closely with many other UN bodies in order to effectually address its mandated issues.As this committee is designed for both beginners and experienced delegates alike, delegates of all abilities are welcome."}
